# Railway Build Fix - October 19, 2025

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Nixpacks TOML Syntax Error
**Error:** `invalid type: map, expected a sequence for key 'providers'`

**Fix:** Changed `[providers]` section from map to array format
```toml
# Before (WRONG)
[providers]
node = "18.x"

# After (CORRECT)
providers = ["node"]
```

### Issue 2: Docker Detection Instead of Nixpacks
**Error:** Railway was using Dockerfile from frontend folder instead of Nixpacks

**Fix:** 
1. Created `.dockerignore` to exclude frontend
2. Updated `railway.json` with explicit build/start commands
3. Added `watchPatterns` to monitor only backend changes

### Issue 3: package-lock.json Not Found
**Error:** `npm ci` failed because it was running from root directory

**Fix:** All commands now explicitly run from `backend/` directory:
- Install: `cd backend && npm ci`
- Build: `cd backend && npm run build`  
- Start: `cd backend && npm start`

## ✅ Files Modified

1. **nixpacks.toml** - Fixed TOML syntax
2. **railway.json** - Added explicit build/start commands
3. **.dockerignore** - Created to exclude frontend
4. **.railwayignore** - Already correct (excludes frontend)

## 🚀 Current Configuration

### railway.json
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "cd backend && npm ci && npm run build",
    "watchPatterns": ["backend/**"]
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && npm start"
  }
}
```

### nixpacks.toml
```toml
providers = ["node"]

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = "false"

[phases.install]
cmds = ["cd backend && npm ci"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["cd backend && npm run build"]

[start]
cmd = "cd backend && npm start"
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway build configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Railway:**
   - Railway will auto-deploy on push
   - OR manually trigger deployment in Railway dashboard

3. **Verify build process:**
   - Watch Railway logs for successful build
   - Build should now:
     ✅ Install dependencies from backend/package-lock.json
     ✅ Build TypeScript from backend/src
     ✅ Start server with Prisma migrations

## 🔍 What Changed

**Before:**
- Railway couldn't parse nixpacks.toml (syntax error)
- Railway detected frontend Dockerfile
- Commands ran from root (no package-lock.json)

**After:**
- ✅ Valid TOML syntax
- ✅ Nixpacks builder forced
- ✅ All commands run from backend/ directory
- ✅ Frontend ignored completely

## 🎯 Expected Build Output

```
✅ Initialization
✅ Build > Build image
   - Installing dependencies (npm ci in backend/)
   - Generating Prisma client
   - Building TypeScript
✅ Deploy
   - Running migrations (npx prisma migrate deploy)
   - Starting server (node dist/server.js)
✅ Post-deploy
```
