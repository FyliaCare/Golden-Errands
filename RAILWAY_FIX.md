# üö® Railway Deployment Fix

## The Issue
Railway tried to build from the root directory, but this is a **monorepo** with separate `backend` and `frontend` services.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Deploy Each Service Separately

### Step 1: Deploy Backend Service

1. **Via Railway Dashboard:**
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Click **"+ New Service"**
   - Select **"GitHub Repo"** 
   - Choose your repository
   - **IMPORTANT**: Set **Root Directory** to `backend`
   - Click Deploy

2. **Via Railway CLI:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   railway up
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend Service

1. **Via Railway Dashboard:**
   - In the same project, click **"+ New Service"** again
   - Select **"GitHub Repo"**
   - Choose your repository again
   - **IMPORTANT**: Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`
   - Click Deploy

2. **Via Railway CLI:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   railway up
   ```

### Step 3: Add Database Service

1. Click **"+ New Service"**
2. Select **"Database"** ‚Üí **"PostgreSQL"**
3. Railway will create the database and provide connection details

## üîß Alternative: Single Service Deployment

If you prefer to deploy as a single service, you can modify the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "golden-errands-monorepo",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "cd backend && npm install && npm run build",
    "start": "cd backend && npm start",
    "postinstall": "cd backend && npm install && cd ../frontend && npm install"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "18"
  }
}
```

But the **separate services approach is recommended** for better scalability and resource management.

## üìù Next Steps

1. Delete the failed deployment attempt
2. Follow the steps above to deploy backend and frontend separately
3. Configure environment variables as described in `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
4. Update CORS settings once both services are running

The separate service deployment will work much better and give you more control over each part of your application!
