# Railway Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Status

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript compiles successfully
- ✅ Prisma schema validated (cuid() for universal compatibility)
- ✅ JWT tokens have expiry times (15m access, 7d refresh)
- ✅ Environment variable fallbacks configured
- ✅ Error handling middleware in place
- ✅ Input validation on all routes
- ✅ Rate limiting configured (100 req/15min)

### Files Cleaned
- ✅ All unwanted documentation removed
- ✅ Duplicate deployment files deleted
- ✅ Temporary/test files removed
- ✅ Only essential files remain

### Configuration
- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway deployment config
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration with PostgreSQL support
- ✅ `.railwayignore` - Excludes frontend and unnecessary files
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Proper version control exclusions
- ✅ `package.json` - Build/runtime scripts separated

## 🚀 Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Production-ready deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Railway Setup
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose: `FyliaCare/Golden-Errands`
5. Railway will auto-detect the configuration

### 3. Add PostgreSQL Database
1. In Railway project dashboard
2. Click "+ New"
3. Select "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
4. Railway automatically sets `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### 4. Set Environment Variables
Required variables (go to project Settings → Variables):
```
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_random_secret_key_here
```

Optional variables (already have defaults in code):
```
NODE_ENV=production  (auto-set by Railway)
PORT=4000           (auto-set by Railway)
```

### 5. Deploy
- Railway automatically builds and deploys
- Monitor build logs for any issues
- Wait for "Deployment successful" message

### 6. Verify Deployment
Test the health endpoint:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T...",
  "environment": "production",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Railway build logs
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure TypeScript compiles locally: `npm run build`

### Database Connection Fails
- Verify PostgreSQL addon is added
- Check `DATABASE_URL` is set automatically by Railway
- Review startup logs for migration errors

### JWT Errors
- Ensure `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is set
- Should be a long random string (min 32 characters)

### Server Won't Start
- Check that `npm start` works locally (with DATABASE_URL)
- Review Railway runtime logs
- Verify `start` script in `package.json`

## 📊 Expected Build Process

Railway will execute:
1. **Install**: `cd backend && npm ci`
2. **Build**: `cd backend && npm run build` (TypeScript compilation only)
3. **Start**: `cd backend && npm start` which runs:
   - `npx prisma generate` (creates Prisma client)
   - `npx prisma migrate deploy` (runs migrations)
   - `node dist/server.js` (starts server)

## 🎯 Post-Deployment

### Test Endpoints
```bash
# Register user
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User"}'

# Login
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!"}'
```

### Monitor
- Railway Dashboard → Logs (runtime logs)
- Railway Dashboard → Metrics (CPU, memory, requests)
- Railway Dashboard → Deployments (history)

## 🔐 Security Checklist
- ✅ JWT secrets not in code
- ✅ Database URL from environment
- ✅ CORS configured properly
- ✅ Rate limiting enabled
- ✅ Input validation on all routes
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Token expiry times set

## 📝 Notes

- Database migrations run automatically on startup
- Prisma client generates at runtime (not build time)
- Frontend is ignored (backend-only deployment)
- Logs directory created automatically
- Uploads directory persists on Railway's ephemeral filesystem

Your application is **100% ready for Railway deployment**! 🎉
